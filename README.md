PhoneTracer - OSINT Tool — PhoneTracer is a simple Python CLI utility that uses the phonenumbers library to parse an international phone number and display basic OSINT information (region/country and associated time zone(s)). Requirements: Python and the phonenumbers package (pip install phonenumbers). Usage: run the script (for example python PhoneNumberCracker.py) and enter a phone number in international format when prompted (e.g. +1(719)299-2167). Example output: PhoneTracer - OSINT then Target = +1(719)299-2167 followed by Location: Colorado and TimeZone: America/Denver. Notes: the script prints the parsed location and a comma-separated list of time zones for the number; it is intended for educational and ethical use only — do not use it to invade privacy or break laws.
